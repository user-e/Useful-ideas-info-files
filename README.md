# Useful ideas+info files
Useful ideas and information, from me, saved as human/machine readable files with a bit of metadata.

\[add things here using note]  
\[create an info file with title heading "Choices in life  
of a thing/service or time", content after metadata: "  
Some choices people make in life are about the question "should you  
spend/use a thing (money, a service) or time (e.g. doing it yourself)?".  
Sometimes when you use less of one, the other is used more.
